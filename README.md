# **Hello World!** My name is  **Daisy**.
## I am an Environmental Science enthusiast passionate about optimising the potential of computer sciences in Climate Change visualisation and projection for decisive action.
## "The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realised how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress." - Prof. Yuval Noah Harari
