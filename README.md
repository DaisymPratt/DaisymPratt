### Hello World! I'm Daisy, an Environmental Science enthusiast, passionate about optimising the potential of computer sciences in Climaate Change visualisation.
## "The greatest scientific discovery was the discovery of ignorance. Once humans realised how little they knew about the world, they suddenly had a very good reason to seek new knowledge, which opened up the scientific road to progress."
